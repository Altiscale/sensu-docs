sensuclient is part of the open source Sensu project ie Sensu Core and it is included in the Sensu Core installer packages along with the Sensu Core server and API processes ie sensuserver and sensuapi This means that if you are following the instructions in this guide for a standalone1 installation your Sensu client is already installed Disabled by default The Sensu client process sensuclient is disabled by default on all platforms Please refer to the corresponding configuration and operation documentation corresponding to the platform where you have installed your Sensu clients for instructions on starting stopping the Sensu client process andor enabling the Sensu client process to start automatically on system boot Install Sensu Core sensucore UbuntuDebian Sensu

Enterprise Linux and their Centos equivalents These packages are generally expected to be compatible with Red Hat derivatives like SuSE Amazon or Scientific Linux but packages are not tested on these platforms The following instructions describe configuring package repository definitions using Yum variables14 as components of the baseurl On Red Hat derivative platforms the value of the releasever variable will not typically align with the RHEL release versions eg 6 or 7 advertised in the Sensu Yum repository Please use 6 or 7 in lieu of releasever on RHEL derivatives depending on whether they use sysv init or systemd respectively NOTE As of Sensu version 027 the yum repository URL has changed to include the releasever variable To install or upgrade to the latest version of Sensu please ensure you have updated existing repository configurations 1 Create the YUM repository configuration file for the Sensu Core repository at etcyumreposdsensurepo shell echo sensu namesensu
